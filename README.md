## Challenges Encountered & Solutions

- **Booking Status Management**  
  Ensuring bookings could be updated by the admin (Scheduled â†’ Completed / Cancelled) required careful access control.  
  **Solution:** Implemented a dedicated `update_booking_status` view using `@user_passes_test(lambda u: u.is_staff)` for function-based views, and `LoginRequiredMixin + UserPassesTestMixin` for class-based views, allowing only staff/admin users to safely change booking status.

- **Preventing Duplicate Feedback**  
  Users could submit feedback multiple times for the same booking.  
  **Solution:** Overrode `dispatch()` in `FeedbackCreateView` to check if feedback already exists for the booking. If it does, the user is redirected with a friendly message.

- **Featured Feedback for Homepage**  
  Admins needed a way to highlight certain feedback dynamically.  
  **Solution:** Added a `featured` boolean field to the `Feedback` model and created a `feature_feedback` view to toggle which feedback appears on the homepage.

## Future Enhancements
## Future Enhancements

- **Payment Integration:** Allow users to pay for bookings directly through the platform and confirm bookings after payment.  
- **Advanced Booking Management:** Enable admin to filter bookings by status, date, or user for easier management.  
- **Flexible Homepage for Admin:** Allow admin to update homepage content dynamically, such as headings, featured sections, or promotional banners.  
- **User Booking Management:** Allow users to cancel or delete their own bookings before the scheduled date.  
- **Improved Styling:** Refactor and clean up CSS to make the UI more consistent, modern, and responsive.  
- **Optimized Frontend:** Reduce redundant CSS, organize stylesheets, and improve layout for better user experience.
